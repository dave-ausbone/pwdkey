pwdkey
======
This piece of code is meant to be used with the Digispark development board or an other Arduino based system. 

If used on a basic digispark, you can store up to two passwords and up to ten with a special shield.
Once plugged into a USB port, you just have to connect pin p0 and the pin corresponding to the password wanted.
The Digispark will simulate a keyboard and write the password.
